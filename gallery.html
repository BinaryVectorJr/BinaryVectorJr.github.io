She loves to explore, and thinks of herself as the new-age Lara Croft-Nathan Drake hybrid - only better. || Changed my concept art style with this one, to include colors and shadowing. Also, this was one of the first artworks to feature my new logo (top right).">
		<img src="/ReferenceImages/Actual/Art/GameArt9_King.jpg" style="width:100%" style="width:100%" onclick="onClick(this)" class="w3-hover-opacity" alt="Concept Art: Konungr Trygve || Concept art of a King looking upon his kingdom, which he knows is about to fall into turmoil, as all the contenders for Konungr (Old Norse for 'King') are not worthy of the power || The character has been heavily inspired by Viking Kings, with some features similar to the charcter Crach an Craite from the game The Witcher 3. I was doing some missions in Skellige in the game, and also trying to gather some information about Old Norse mythologies, when I got inspired to sketch him.">
		<img src="/ReferenceImages/Actual/Art/GameArt2.jpg" style="width:100%" style="width:100%" onclick="onClick(this)" class="w3-hover-opacity" alt="Concept Art: Balahoff The Guardian || Concept art for the dragon that guards the legendary artifact, The Hellblade, that lies embedded in the Obsidian courtyard of the Castle Ga'ar. It is said that the sword contains the power to control and summon the mythical beast, and control it.|| This was the direct result of watching too much Game of Thrones in one day, and also Dark Souls. So the thought creeped into my head that what if there was a weapon that could summon this mythical beast and in the end of the day, which could only be obtained by defating it first in a series of battles. Also, I intended this to be the (unofficial) backstory of how the Nameless King (from Dark Souls 3) came into existance. It was my way of putting my own twist in the lore of Dark Souls 3.">
		<img src="/ReferenceImages/Actual/Compositions/Logos/StreetSangam-01.jpg" style="width:100%" style="width:100%" onclick="onClick(this)" class="w3-hover-opacity" alt="Logo: Street Sangam || The literal meaning of the name is 'fusion of (different) paths'. This was done for an event being organised by MOX (Movement of Expression) which is an organization that caters to services such as Event Management, Talent Management, PR, Photography, as well as hosting various events around India. || Through the logo, I had to bring out the vibrance and euphoria that India provides in terms of art forms, and along with that, I had to convey the message that this was an event where various art forms from all around the country would come together, and the best way I thought this was possible is throught he use of vibrant colours, patterns, and of course the elephant and peacock silhouette, to give it that exotic feel.">

This was one of those 'greatest game ever' moments in my life, because of how well woven the story was, and because of that exquisite level design. Couple that with the fact that Mass Effect 3 was the ending to such a beautiful trilogy, and it makes a vary powerful combination - one that will surely be etched into my mind for a long time.">

It's body is formed from the fusion of molten lava, and the earth itself, making it an all-powerful force. Only a Deva (God) can defeat it by putting it into a trance like state. || The inspiration of this creature has been drawn from monsters such as the Cloverfield Monster, Kronos, Surtur and other fire-based-kaiju hybrid creatures. I do plan to turn it into a video game boss someday.">

I oversaw all design decisions, and other design projects such as posters, stickers, banners, flyers, etc. This poster showcases the 4 major events in the fest, that were the main attraction.">

Scar's major area of operation is the post-apocalyptic cyberpunk city of Detroit. He loves guns, bacon, and most important of all, Don Carlos cigars. || Okay this is pretty simple to figure out. I watched Altered Carbon, and fell in love with the character of Takeshi Kovacs. So I drew this version of him based on the sleeve of Elias Ryker (played by Joel Kinnaman). Takeshi (Elias Ryker) definitely ranks very high on my list of Top 10 Fictional Characters. ">

A poster generally has fewer words and the visual aspect of it is much more prominent than the words - hence why I chose to call it an e-information flyer.">

I was fortunate enough to be chosen as the Head of Design for the event, and the club I was in (BEAM-VIT) was selected as the Organizing Club. This was the main logo of the event. The overall logo denotes the coming together of engineering (the gears) and nature (the leaf). My end goal was to create awareness about the fact that most of the engineering marvels we see around the world have been inspired by nature itself, in one way or the other. The logo was also developed keeping in mind the materialistic design elements that Google had introduced into the designing industry.">

We had to come up with a name, a logo for it and try to make it as interesting  as possible. I chose the design for the logo based on the pattern which we find on the sides of Puma shoes, which is it's differentiating feature from other brands. Also, I threw in Sergio Aguero, because he endorses Puma boots (and is one of my favourite finishers in the Premiere League).">

The trend at that time, was a meme that resembled the format of 'Life-(something relavant-Death' and I tried to capitalize on tha tfact.">
